# Implementation of the Johnson–Bossler–Naumann (JBN) method   

## Estimating the two-phase relative permeabilities from unsteady-state core flooding data

 
This repository contains supplementary materials to the paper[^fn1] for setting up and running a core flooding simulation using [MRST](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/), estimating the relative permeabilities with the JBN method[^fn2], and for comparing the results with the groud truth data.

## Dependencies

The forward simulation model has been tested with MRST 2023a and 2023b.
